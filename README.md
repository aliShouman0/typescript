> ## What is TypeScript?

<br>

- ### TypeScript is JavaScript with syntax for types. <br>

  TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.

- ### JavaScript and More <br>

  TypeScript adds additional syntax to JavaScript to support a tighter integration with your editor. Catch errors early in your editor.

- ### A Result You Can Trust <br>

  TypeScript code converts to JavaScript, which runs anywhere JavaScript runs: In a browser, on Node.js or Deno and in your apps.

- ### Safety at Scale <br>
  TypeScript understands JavaScript and uses type inference to give you great tooling without additional code.
